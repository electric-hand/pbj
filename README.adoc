# Pretty Badass Jenerator

## Alternative Acronymics
* Project Builder Joyfest
* Prescriptively Better Jack-of-all-trades
* Pretty Big Jest

## About
This tool generates projects declaritively based on a simple toml format.  It currently has built in support for generating `npm/node/typescript` projects (with pettier, eslint, and jest) and `poetry/python` with pytest.

## Why?
There are other project generators out there, mostly in the javascript space (yeoman, npm based create scripts), but I wanted something fully declarative where I could inspect the project declaration and understand _exactly_ what it is doing. Also I wanted to bang on in some Rust.

## Usage
The easiest way to use is simply to copy either the typescript or python templates from this repo and customize for your toolset.

### Preconditions
Your chosen project must:

- have a binary used to execute code (`python`, `node`, etc.)
- have a tool to manage projects
- said tool needs to be able to:
  - initialize projects
  - add dependencies as a list
  - run unit tests
